# Calculating Arm Angles Using Statcast Data

## Introduction
This project is from a very [old](https://github.com/logananthony/arm-angles-statcast/blob/main/Calculating%20Arm%20Angles%20Using%20Statcast%20Data%20%7C%20Rundown%20Baseball.pdf) article of mine but I found the moitivation to resurrect it from a thread on Twitter/X where Trevor Thrash shared his own arm angle calculations in [python](https://github.com/trevorwthrash/armAngles) - check it out! Anyway, this project aims to calculate the arm angles of pitchers using Statcast/Lahman data in R. The motivation for this project originated from the 2020 ALCS, where the diversity in release points of the Rays pitching staff was highlighted in a [graph](https://github.com/logananthony/arm-angles-statcast/blob/main/2020%20Rays%20Graph.jpg) during one of the games. Although release points are crucial for understanding pitcher performance, they do not provide a complete picture. Hopefully this method aims to add another piece to the puzzle, enhancing our broader understanding of pitcher performance.

## Calculation Method
The calculation of arm angles involves forming triangles using the release position metrics provided by Statcast and height data from Lahman. The key steps include:
1. **Defining the Axes**: The Y-axis works vertically from home plate to center field, and the X-axis measures horizontal distance east to west. The Z-axis measures height.
2. **Forming Triangles**: Using the average release positions, a triangle is formed where the hypotenuse represents the pitcher's arm.
3. **Calculating Angles**: By using trigonometric equations, the arm angle (Î¸) is calculated in radians and then converted to degrees.


## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps (I should also note I didn't incldue any packages to retrieve the statcast data but [baseballr](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) is a great one for R or if you prefer python [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) is equally fantastic!):

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/logananthonymlb/arm-angles-statcast.git
    cd arm-angles-statcast
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```r
    install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "Lahman"))
    ```

3. **Run the Calculations**:
    Open `arm-angles.Rmd` in RStudio and knit the document to produce the results.
