# Calculating Arm Angles Using Statcast Data

## Introduction
From an [old](https://github.com/logananthony/arm-angles-statcast/blob/main/Calculating%20Arm%20Angles%20Using%20Statcast%20Data%20%7C%20Rundown%20Baseball.pdf) article of mine, this project aims to calculate the arm angles of pitchers using Statcast data in R. The motivation for this project originated from the 2020 ALCS, where the diversity in release points of the Rays pitching staff was highlighted in a [graph](https://github.com/logananthony/arm-angles-statcast/blob/main/2020%20Rays%20Graph.jpg) during one of the games. This was the primary motivation behind calculating arm angles; the pursuit to further enhance our understanding of pitchers' mechanics and their impact on performance. Of course this is just a method of approximation, we could very likely get the accurate measurments of this as time goes on so take it for what it's worth.

## Research Questions
Here are some key questions that this project seeks to address:
- How are arm angles distributed among pitchers?
- Do bullpens with a high variance in arm angles perform better?
- What is the relationship of arm angles between pitches?
- Do pitchers with dramatically different arm angles between pitches perform statistically worse?
- How accurately can spin axes be calculated from arm angle?
- How can we understand pitchers who purposely change arm angles, like Rich Hill or Nestor Cortes, better?
- Do pitchers with certain arm slots throw pitch X or pitch Y better than pitchers without that arm slot?
- Can we use arm angles to better classify pitchers using cluster algorithms?
- How do arm angles change with age?
- How can arm angle consistency be defined?

## Calculation Method
The calculation of arm angles involves forming triangles using the release position metrics provided by Statcast. The key steps include:
1. **Defining the Axes**: The Y-axis works vertically from home plate to center field, and the X-axis measures horizontal distance east to west. The Z-axis measures height.
2. **Forming Triangles**: Using the average release positions, a triangle is formed where the hypotenuse represents the pitcher's arm.
3. **Calculating Angles**: By using trigonometric equations, the arm angle (Î¸) is calculated in radians and then converted to degrees.


## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/logananthonymlb/arm-angles-statcast.git
    cd arm-angles-statcast
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```r
    install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2"))
    ```

3. **Run the Calculations**:
    Open `arm-angles.Rmd` in RStudio and knit the document to produce the results.
